# Codingbat Exercises

This repository contains exercises from [Codingbat](https://codingbat.com/python). For each type of exercise, I’ve provided a solution to the first question. You can use my coding style (docstrings, testing, etc.) as a guide to solve the remaining questions.

This exercise is optional, with no grading or time constraints. However, I highly recommend trying to solve all the questions independently. **Please avoid using AI tools or searching for solutions online.**

## How to submit

1. **Fork** this base repository.
2. **Clone** your forked repository (`https://github.com/<your-id>/codingbat`) to your computer. This repository should be in a separate folder from `oim3640` or any other GitHub repository.
3. Read [my solution demo code](warmup-1/sleep_in.py) before you start.
4. **Commit and push** your work to GitHub once you’ve completed one or more exercises. Confirm the updates on your GitHub page.
5. If you have difficulty solving problems, you can:
   - Mention me in **Issues** of your `codingbat` repo,
   - Create a **pull request** to the base repo, or
   - DM me on **Slack**.
6. (Occasionally, in fact very rarely) I may ask to review your progress via a pull request, followed by a Coding Chat to discuss it.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns/comments.
